Introduction:
In this project, we have created a model which can make predictions on the fake_news dataset to detect fake news. For the model, we implemented a LinearSVC model with basic pre-processing and tested
the performance of the model using K-fold testing. We have further made improvements to the model using various pre-processing and feature extraction techniques.

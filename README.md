Introduction:
In this project, I have created a model which can make predictions on the fake_news dataset to detect fake news. This model is implemented using LinearSVC model with pre-processing and tested the performance of the model using K-fold testing. Further improvements were made to the model using various pre-processing and feature extraction techniques.
